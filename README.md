Monos Apps are apps that extend your Monos experience. The GitHub repository for each Gurapp are seperate from the `monos-corp.github.io` GitHub repository.

# Running Locally
Monos Apps: You must download the Monos Apps from each GitHub repository and place them in the root directory in order for Gurapps to work correctly with Monos locally.

Assets: You must edit the directory path in the code, since every path assumes that the asset is in root.

# Credits
Monos is based on Gurasuraisu.
